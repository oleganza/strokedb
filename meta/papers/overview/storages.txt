STORAGES OVERVIEW

StrokeDB stores 2 kinds of things:

1) Documents with all their versions.
2) Views' index files.

Documents are stored in the "document storages", 
view indexes are stored in (sic!) the "view storages".

Document storage does two simple things:
1) Gives a document for a given UUID (or UUID.VERSION)
2) Stores a document with a given UUID.VERSION
Also it allows you to iterate over all the documents,
but this is done inside a View reindexing.

View indexes are stored as ordered lists of key-value tuples.
Value is a document UUID (or UUID.VERSION), key is an arbitrary 
structure relevant to the particular View.

Views answer search queries and update the index with a #update method.


DOCUMENT STORAGE





The only "write" operation exposed by API is a Document#save! method.
